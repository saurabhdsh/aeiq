### Flight Disruption Management
- **End-to-end disruption handling**: Complete workflow from detection to resolution for flight delays/cancellations
- **Cascading impact analysis**: AI-powered assessment of how disruptions affect aircraft, crew, passengers, and operations
- **Multi-category recommendation engine**: Provides immediate actions, short-term planning, passenger handling, and resource optimization suggestions
- **Interactive deployment system**: Beautiful deployment flow with step-by-step progress visualization
- **Sabre CMS Integration**: Connects directly with Sabre Crew Management System for crew reassignments

### Technical Highlights
- **Advanced React patterns**: Programmatic component creation using React.createElement
- **Sophisticated state management**: Maintains complex conversation flows and UI states
- **Beautiful animations**: Includes fade, slide, pulse, rotate, and bounce effects for engaging UX
